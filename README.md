## Running Dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.

## _TestCafe_ end-to-end Tests

TestCafe provides an option of writing cross-browser functional tests in JavaScript. It's like write once and run on different browsers just by changing command.

I have tested this frontend on 3 browsers.

```bash
npm run test:chrome
npm run test:safari
npm run test:firefox

```
